Once aupon a time...
Once upon a time, this was a famous thief lived in the city. No one knows the thief’s identity, and they just call the thief “Shadow”. From general’s arsenal to gangsters’ vault, Shadow has been to every highly secured spot, and never been caught.
Those in power set up a trap for Shadow, and Shadow did come. Covered with countless wounds, Shadow still managed to escape. However, Shadow lost consciousness on the way home because of massive bleeding.

Shadow woke up in a hospital. He realized he was hurt but didn't remember anything....

He took a lot of Advil because he was still in a lot of pain. It was a great struggle for him to even walk. He found a spare set of crutches and fled the building, determined to get revenge and those who had wronged him...

He noticed that there is a wound of strange shape on his chest. He's pretty sure that this wound was caused by something like a sickle， and he happened to know somebody use that as weapon.

A woman in black was sitting next to Shadow. She said,"I have been waiting for you for a long time."
Who the hack she is? I was thinking....

"The only person who uses sickle as weapon in this town is 'Pudge'."The women continues speaking,"I will be on your side if you are planning to revenge him."
