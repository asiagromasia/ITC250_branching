Once aupon a time...
Once upon a time, this was a famous thief lived in the city. No one knows the thief’s identity, and they just call the thief “Shadow”. From general’s arsenal to gangsters’ vault, Shadow has been to every highly secured spot, and never been caught.
Those in power set up a trap for Shadow, and Shadow did come. Covered with countless wounds, Shadow still managed to escape. However, Shadow lost consciousness on the way home because of massive bleeding.

Shadow woke up in a hospital. He realized he was hurt but didn't remember anything....
